HEY I'M ZAVRIS 
When I was first introduced to GitHub, I had no idea what it was or what it could do. Between you and me, I created the account because I was told every developer should have one where they push their code.

For the longest time as a beginner I did nothing with my account. But then, becuase of my passion in tech, I started following other developers and checking out their work on GitHub. And I noticed something they had in common: they all had cool projects and contributed to open source, but their projects also had detailed README files.
